### Metrics (concise)

- Price percentile (1y) - +1.91% - Why it matters: cheap vs 1y history.

- Turnover (Vol/Cap) - +2.83% - Why it matters: higher turnover usually means easier entry/exit.
- NVT proxy - 35.31 - Why it matters: very high values can mean price is running ahead of usage.
- Max drawdown (1y) - -49.63% - Why it matters: shows pain tolerance needed to hold long term.

### What Must Be True

- Usage and volume trend must stay stable or improve.
- Liquidity must remain healthy during risk-off periods.

### Scenario Table

| Case | Implied Price | Move vs Current | Core assumption |
|---|---:|---:|---|

| Base | $101,651 | +46.19% | Gradual mean reversion. |
| Bull | $112,950 | +62.44% | Strong adoption with stable macro. |

### Disconfirming Evidence

### Method Notes

- Scores use normalized pillars (0-100) and weighted sum.
- Some metrics are approximations (for example NVT proxy).
